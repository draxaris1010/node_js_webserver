# Node.js webServer

This is a webserver written in JavaScript.

It uses the library called [mmmagic](https://github.com/mscdex/mmmagic) in combination with [nan](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) for detecting the mime type from any file based on the contents.
Install them by typing:
```
npm install mmmagic
```
and:
```
npm install nan
```
